    "[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) stands for numerical Python. It's the backbone of all kinds of scientific and numerical computing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since machine learning is all about turning data into numbers and then figuring out the patterns, NumPy often comes into play.\n",

    "## Why NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do numerical calculations using pure Python. In the beginning, you might think Python is fast but once your data gets large, you'll start to notice slow downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons you use NumPy is because it's fast. Behind the scenes, the code has been optimized to run using C. Which is another programming language, which can do things much faster than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this being behind the scenes is you don't need to know any C to take advantage of it. You can write your numerical computations in Python using NumPy and get the added speed benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your curious as to what causes this speed benefit, it's a process called vectorization. [Vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization) aims to do calculations by avoiding loops as loops can create potential bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy achieves vectorization through a process called [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html#module-numpy.doc.broadcasting)."
